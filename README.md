# Sturctures of Programming Languages Project

In my Project I decided to compare C++ and Python. 

I made a simple class in C++ to showcase differences. 

# Garbage Collection:
C++: In C++ there is not Garbage Collection or a Garbage collector. The Programmer has to do deallocation on their own, it is not done automactially like in Python. In fact C++ uses a compiler not an Interpreter.
