# Sturctures of Programming Languages Project

In my Project I decided to compare C++ and Python. 

I made simple classes in C++ and Python to showcase differences. I made a simple coordinate or point Class, which is just that it can have a order pair of numbers of the form (x, y) or (x, y, z) for 2-Dimensional and 3-Dimensional Space. 

# Garbage Collection:
C++: In C++ there is not Garbage Collection or a Garbage collector. The Programmer has to do deallocation on their own, it is not done automactially like in Python. In fact C++ uses a compiler not an Interpreter. 

For my Point class I have to Include a Destructor for deallocating the Dynamic Memory usage, in order to recycle or reuse that memory.

Python: In Python there is a Garbage Collector which automatically recycles memory for you. It Deallocates the dynamic memory too. Python also uses an Interpreter, which allows the file to be directly executed instead of creating an executable from compilation. 

# Declaration:
C++: You always have to Specify what type is the variable in Declarations in C++. 

Python: You don't have to specify the type of the variable in the Declartions in Python. 

# Speed:
C++: Uses Compilation which is Faster than using a Interpreter. It also uses Static typing which means it does type checks during Compile time rather than Runtime. Statically typed langauges must state the type of the variable. 

# Parameter Passing
