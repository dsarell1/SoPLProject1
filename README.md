# Sturctures of Programming Languages Project

In my Project I decided to compare C++ and Python. 

I made simple classes in C++ and Python to showcase differences. I made a simple coordinate or point Class, which is just that it can have a order pair of numbers of the form (x, y) or (x, y, z) for 2-Dimensional and 3-Dimensional Space. 

# Garbage Collection:
C++: In C++ there is not Garbage Collection or a Garbage collector. The Programmer has to do deallocation on their own, it is not done automactially like in Python. In fact C++ uses a compiler not an Interpreter. C++ also uses pointers for Dynamic Memory Allocation.

For my Coordinates class in C++ I have to Include a Destructor for deallocating the Dynamic Memory usage, in order to recycle or reuse that memory. 

Python: In Python there is a Garbage Collector which automatically recycles memory for you. It Deallocates the dynamic memory too. Python also uses an Interpreter, which allows the file to be directly executed instead of creating an executable from compilation. So it can catch Runtime Variable Changes.

For my Point Class in Python 

# Declaration:
C++: You always have to Specify what type is the variable in Declarations in C++. 

For my Coordinates Class in C++ I have to Explicitly state the type of all the paramters, Agruments, function return types and variables. 

Python: You don't have to specify the type of the variable in the Declartions in Python. 

For my Point Class in Python I don't Have to set any Variable Declarations for any Functions, Parameters or Variables.

# Speed:
C++: Uses Compilation which is Faster than using a Interpreter. It also uses Static typing which means it does type checks during Compile time rather than Runtime. One Disadvantage is that it will miss runtime events and makes it harder for Dynamic Memory. Statically typed langauges must state the type of the variable. 

Python: Uses an Interpreter which is slower than Compilation due to the fact that it is Dynamic typing. Dynamic typing does types checks at Runtime, during Execution. Dynamically Typed languages are not required to state the type of the Variable. 

# Parameter Passing
