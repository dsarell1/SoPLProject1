In my Project I decided to compare C++ and Python. 

I made a simple class in C++ to showcase differences. 

# Garbage Collection:
C++: In C++ there is not Garbage Collection or a Garbage collector. The Programmer has to do deallocation on their own, it is not done automactially like in Python. In fact C++ uses a compiler not an Interpreter.

Python: In Python there is a Garbage Collector which automatically recycles memory for you. It Deallocates the dynamic memory too. Python also uses an Interpreter, which allows the file to be directly executed instead of creating an executable from compilation. 

# Declaration:
C++: You always have to Specify what type is the variable in Declarations in C++. 

Python: You don't have to specify the type of the variable in the Declartions in Python. 

# Speed:


# Parameter Passing
